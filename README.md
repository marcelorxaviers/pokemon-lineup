# pokemon-lineup
## Considerations
I know nothing about Pokemons (I like anime, but I have never watched the Pokemon series :disappointed:). So, I'm sorry in advance if I did any mistake in terms of how the line up work in the anime.
I kept the interface as simple as possible, that's why the Pokemon Data area is an open text area, so that one can insert whatever he/she thinks that is important on the Pokemon context (again, I don't really know what is a customizable characteristic for a Pokemon in the universe of the series).

Even though I'm still learning react, I did choose to use it so that I could test my learnings and receive useful feedbacks on how to improve my skills.
